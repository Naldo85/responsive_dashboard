# responsive_dashboard

#### We use modern HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create a fully responsive admin panel with light and dark mode theming functionality. We use CSS variables, CSS grid, CSS flexbox, media queries for our responsive design, and CSS transitions and animations for some cool animation effects.
